1.	Classes are an expanded concept of data structures: like data structures, they can contain data members, but they can also contain functions as members.

2.	Members defined as public are accessible to all parts of the program.

Members defined as private are not accessible to code that uses the class. The private sections hide the implementation from code that uses the type.

Data abstraction is the mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.
Data encapsulation is the mechanism of bundling the data and protecting sensitive information in an object by making members private.
Data hiding is an extreme version of encapsulation where the user can’t even see the data.

3.	A class denotes a category of objects. An object exhibits the property and behavior defined by its class. An object is an instance of its class.

4.	The work that a class does is performed by its member functions. The state that it maintains is stored in its data members.

6.	A class constructor is automatically called whenever a new object of this class is created. A destructor is called to clean up when an object is no longer necessary.

8.	A default constructor is a constructor which can be called with no arguments. One of its advantages is that it is used when an array of objects is called.

10.	 this is a pointer to current object, *this is a copy of the object so changes don’t persist.
